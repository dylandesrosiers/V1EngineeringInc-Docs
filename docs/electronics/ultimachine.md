UltiMachine boards are extremely high quality and built as the refined updated Ramps 1.4 board.
Meaning it is a more reliable board and it has been designed with more robust safety features built
in (harder to destroy these boards by accident). Hopefully this will result in a more pleasant user
experience for the newcomers to electronics. These boards are using trusted high quality components
and assembled in the U.S. Johnny R from UltiMachine designed the original Ramps series of boards and
these are the next generations from him and his team.  There are many improved features including
properly implemented drivers with more efficient heat transfer, replaceable fuses, isolated USB,
more ports, More control from the firmware did I mention _DIGI-POTS!!!_.

The boards are more expensive than the current ramps boards but have no assembly required and I am
expecting a nearly non existent failure rate (still true). These two factors mean I can have a much
lower markup on them than the ramps. These boards also have the driver current that is set in the
firmware meaning much less setup and testing time for me as well, again lowering the need for a
steep markup and more accurate control over your steppers. The mini-Rambo has four drivers, this
means no [dual endstop firmware](dual-endstops.md) on this board with out some skills and an external driver.

There is much more information available from [UltiMachine](https://ultimachine.com/) or the Wiki
links in each section.

## Firmware

!!! note "Looking for firmware?"
    The firmware details for all boards can be found [HERE](marlin-firmware.md)

## Mini Rambo

Shop [link](https://vicious1-com.myshopify.com/collections/parts/products/mini-rambo-1-3)

All the Details you could need, http://reprap.org/wiki/MiniRambo

The most common way the Mini Rambo will be used on the Mostly Printed CNC or LowRider CNC, will just
be power and the X, Y, and Z steppers. The board is labeled clearly on each port.

### Adding an LCD

If you are using an LCD the header adapter is not needed and you can plug it directly into the
board as shown.

![!lcd](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_20170503_124808.jpg){: width="400"}

### Adding an Extruder

To use an extruder you will need to flash the extruder enabled firmware or set the firmware to your
appropriate thermistor value (Most commonly 11). You will then need to plug in your extruder heater,
Thermistor to port **T0**, your print fan to port **fan 1**, and your extruder stepper into **E0**.

![!extruder](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_20170503_130652.jpg){:width="400"}

### Adding a Heated Bed

**In addition to all the wires above**, you will need to add what is shown in the picture below.
Everything else has been removed for clarity. The firmware will need to have the heated bed
thermistor value set (Usually to 11). You will need to add the bed thermistor to port **T1**, power to
both inputs A&B, and of course the bed plugs into the heated bed port.

![!bed](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_20170503_130945-1.jpg)

!!! warning
    The port in this picture with the big arrow next to it should have your bed thermistor wires in
    it. Otherwise, it will just heat up forever.

### Adding a Laser Pin / BlTouch / Spare PWM

`Pin 23` is the signal pin for the ZMax endstop it is PWM capable and usually unused. For the BLTouch
you will need to designate it for a “servo”.

### Formal Details

If you have any doubts or are unclear on anything the wiki page should have all your answers.

### Driver Math

These can now be set in
[Configuration_adv.h](https://github.com/Allted/Marlin/blob/MPCNC_MRambo_T8_16T_LCD/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h)

```C
#define PWM_MOTOR_CURRENT {950, 950, 950} //XY,Z,E
```

### Bonus

#### Connectors/Plugs

![!plugs](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_20170503_130811.jpg){: width="300"}

If you have plugs that do not fit the the sockets on the Mini Rambo, you can persuade them to come
off and usually your plugs will fit the bare pins.

## Rambo 1.3 -1.4

![!rambo](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MVIMG_20180207_1608522.jpg)

Shop [link](https://vicious1-com.myshopify.com/collections/parts/products/rambo-v1-3l)

The most common way the Rambo will be used on the Mostly Printed CNC or LowRider CNC is to plug in
the X, Y, and Z steppers. Then you need power to both the logic and stepper circuits.

### Power

![!power](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MVIMG_20180207_1615342.jpg){: width="400"}

You can add a Short jumper to get power to both ports, mind the polarity. The board does have labels
but the Diagram below should be a little more clear.

### Adding an LCD

??? "Rambo 1.4"
    The **Rambo 1.4** no longer needs an adapter but the first batch have shrouded pins (custom
    un-shrouded 1.4’s are on the way). This means some of the LCD cables will be backwards…
    [Easy fix here](https://www.v1engineering.com/forum/topic/rambo-1-4-and-lcd-issues/#post-60917).

??? "Rambo 1.3"
    Using an LCD requires an adapter on the full sized **Rambo 1.3**.

### Adding a Laser Pin

![!pins](https://www.v1engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/IMG_20180626_1559002.jpg){: width="300"}

When using a laser or a PID controller the Pins on MX2 are available:

45 (PWM)
:   Your laser pin or PID speed. Controlled by `M3`

31 (Laser or PID)
:   Enable, Controlled by `M5`

23 (not assigned yet)
:   Shared with $Y_{MAX}$

### Driver Math

These can now be set in
[Configuration_adv.h](https://github.com/Allted/Marlin/blob/MPCNC_MRambo_T8_16T_LCD/Marlin/Configuration_adv.h)

$I_{Trip}^{MAX}$
:   Max Current. As stated Setting the drivers to 70%-90% of max rated amps is a good idea (70% seems pretty good to me.)

$V_{Ref} = I_{Trip}^{MAX} * 0.8$
:   Reference Voltage for the driver. This gives you the ideal test point voltage.

$W_v = (V_{Ref} / 1.66) * 255$
:   The PWM value needed (if you are using a rambo stop here I believe))

```C
// Motor current PWM conversion, PWM value = MotorCurrentSetting * 255 / range
#define MOTOR_CURRENT_PWM_RANGE 2000
#define DEFAULT_PWM_MOTOR_CURRENT  {900, 900, 900}
```

`DEFAULT_PWM_MOTOR_CURRENT` $= Wv/255*2000$
:   Values are XY, Z, E

## Archim

Shop [link](https://vicious1-com.myshopify.com/collections/miscellaneous/products/archim-1-0a)

Wiki links, 
[Archim 1](http://reprap.org/wiki/Archim_v1.0) & [Archim 2](http://reprap.org/wiki/Archim_v2.0)

Before you ask, the only difference is the Archim 2 uses Trinamic drivers. This is setup up
extremely similar to the Rambo board except no LCD adapter is needed.
